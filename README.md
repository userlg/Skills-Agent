# 🌌 Antigravity Skill Agents: Central Arsenal

Welcome to the **Central Arsenal** of skills for Antigravity AI! This repository is a massive ecosystem designed for self-evolution, knowledge management, and advanced automation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Antigravity Version**: `1.107.0`
> **Arsenal Status**: 620+ Skills operational and optimized.

## 🚀 The "Central Hub" Strategy

This repository (`d:\Projects\AI\Skill Agents`) functions as the **Master Brain**.
- **Continuous Improvement**: This is where skills are refined and new ones are created.
- **Distribution**: To use these skills in other projects, use the deployment protocol.

## 🛠️ How to Use (SOP Protocol)

### 1. Infection (Deployment)
To inject this arsenal into a new project:
```powershell
.\deploy-skills.ps1 -TargetPath "C:\Path\To\Your\Project"
```

### 2. Bootstrapping
Once in the target project, ask the agent:
> *"Initialize the project context following your protocols."*
